Archive file extraction and reconstruction tool for THE IDOLM@STER SP.  

## Important

This application requires ActivePerl and Strawberry Perl to be installed.  
Please note that the application will not run without them installed.  
This is because Perl scripts are used to extract and rebuild archive files.  

[ActivePerl](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/)  
[Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)  

## Details

The archive file can only read the genuine files of  
*THE IDOLM@STER SP Perfect Sun, Wandering Star, and Missing Moon.*  
Already modified or corrupted archive files cannot be read.  

## Be sure to purchase an authorized ROM and suck it out.  
Do not obtain archive files by unauthorized means.  
For example, download ROMs that have fallen off the Web and extract the files.  
Those can be serious offenses.  
This application is not designed to facilitate them.  
If these things are ignored, the producer assumes no responsibility.
